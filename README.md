# PortCtl: a CLI tool for Portainer

PortCtl intends to be a friendly tool for leveraging [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) APIS when deploying stacks in continuous delivery pipelines.

In its current version only authentication to the portainer server and creating/updating Swarm stacks is supported. More features will come as development continues.
